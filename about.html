                    <h2>Kim Jung Gi</h2>
                    <p>Is a <em>South Korean</em> artist specializing in line-drawing and comic book illustration. Born in 1975, he studied fine arts at the <em>Dong-Eui University of Busan</em>. He served in the military for 2 years during which time he memorized a huge number of vehicles and weapons which he can now draw from memory. He has the innate ability to mentally visualize his pictures before making a single mark. It’s hard to believe he doesn’t use any photographic references during his process!</p>

He was in the Special Forces section, where he memorised an amazing number of vehicles and weapons. Gi has always enjoyed drawing mechanical parts. This is more of a military dream – He'd love to be part of a history-making operation.</ul>

                    <p>His passion for comic started when he was 6 years old, when he received a sketchbook as a gift. The sketchbook contained an image of a fish with a scuba gear and floating in air. He thought that image was cool and wanted to draw images like that. He wanted to be an artist who draws not only what he wants to draw, but also who can draw the viewer’s imagination in as well.</p>
